      <h2>What is Leka? </h2><br>
      <p>Leka is a Bitcoin SMS messaging project under the guidance of the Senderon team as part of the
        community project support initiative. Not only will it act as a regular messaging application in future
        iterations (android and IOS applications) but it will integrate Bitcoin, Ethereum and Senderon wallets
        which will allow features for users not currently avaliable elsewhere..

      <h2>How will Leka Desktop benefit users?</h2><br>
      <p>The internet often eliminates the need for SMS these days but for times without an internet connection, SMS reigns supreme. This method allows for people to be “carrier free” in which they send messages as they need to without the need of a contract or SIM card. All that would be required is the App or use of the website. Future versions will also allow the transacting of cryptocurrency internationally with minimal fees.</p>
